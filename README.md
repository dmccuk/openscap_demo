## openscap_demo

This demo is all about installing and setting up OpenScap so you can check if your servers are secure and hardened. Similiar tool like CIS and Nessus offer the same reports, but openscap is free.

More info: https://www.open-scap.org/

## Pre-requisites and instructions:

To be able to use this demo code, I've written a very basic terraform module to manage the server creatiogn in AWS.

1) git clone https://github.com/dmccuk/openscap_demo.git
2) cd openscap_demo
3) create your ssh key:

````
$ ssh-keygen -f sshkey #no passkey for the demo

````

4) Set your AWS access & secret keys in awscli - (https://linuxtechlab.com/easy-way-to-install-aws-cli-on-linux/)
5) terraform init
6) terraform plan
7) terraform apply
8) Watch your EC2 instance build in eu-west-2. The server will create an initial report of itself with a pre-openscap scan. Once complete, it will set up some audit rules before re-running the scan.

Feel free to change any of the variables to your own specifications.

9) Once built, visit the webpage reports directory: **http://<your-IP-address>/reports**
10) check the difference between the two reports.

If you want to make a manual update and see the results, do the following:

````


# cp common-report.html /var/www/html/reports/post-common-report1.html
````
